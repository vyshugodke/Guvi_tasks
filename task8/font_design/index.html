            <p>
                There’s more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than focusing on block style information architecture, you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring.

            <p>
                Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It’s now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, providing a responsive, user-friendly experience
                for mobile users.

                Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their message and vision into one dynamic web design page.

                <p style="color: black;">These days, scrolling is so simple that it’s become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page requires thought and motivation. A single page website allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, than
                    needing to sift through multiple pages.</p>

            </h1>
            <p style="color: black;">
                One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results page
                (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.

                <span>S</span>LOWER LOAD TIMES
                <p>
                    50% of website users bounce oﬀ the page if it hasn’t loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax websites, and
                    found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded within a few seconds.

                <span>A</span> WKWARD NAVIGATION
                <p style="color: black;">
                    Instead of hitting the “back” button, users must scroll back up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category
                    or section.
